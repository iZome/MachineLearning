# Assignment 2 - Machine Learning

In this assignment I’ll be looking at the performance of different models when fitting a data created by a unknown mode. In ”Task 1” two linear models with an offset is fitted to dataset and the relative performance is measured. ”Task 2” looks at making legendre based model and fit them to a dataset made from a sinus function. Different values for
λ, the regularization parameter is used.
In ”Task 3” a set of facial images are processed and used to produce eigenfaces. This task evolves around eigenfaces and how they can be used to reconstruct a picture.
