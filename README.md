# MachineLearning

In this repository the assignments and projects done in a Machine Learning course. 
The two assignments contains code for fitting Legendre polinomials to data with noise and the use of eigennodes.
In the project several Machine Learning methods are used to recognise handwritten numbers. Some of the methods are Convoluation and Artifical neural etworks, Random Forest and Support Vector Machines.

All contain report with analysis and figures. 

## R

The code used is written in R and utilize many of the supported packages. I usually run the code on the command line, but editors/IDEA's such as RStudio works as well.
